# netload

`netload` is a very simple network traffic visualizer for the terminal. It shows
a moving bar graph representing the inbound network traffic and small box with
RX and TX traffic in kilobytes.

It's build on the
[`systeminformation`](https://github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation)
library and the [`blessed`](https://github.com/chjj/blessed) terminal toolkit
library, as well as a slightly modified version of the
[`blessed-contrib`](https://github.com/yaronn/blessed-contrib) widget
collection.

It represents my very first clumsy steps with Node.js.
